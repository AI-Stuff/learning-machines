# Learning Machines

Learning machine is a webservice written with [Iron](https://github.com/iron/iron).

It will eventually (hopefully) give a number of interactive machine learning tutorials
using [rusty-machine](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rusty-machine) to do computation.

## Running

Install cargo/rust using [rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#installation).

Navigate to directory and use `cargo run`.

To run while watching for template updates use `cargo run --features dev`

Right now the web service is very empty and with little to no error handling.
More coming soon!

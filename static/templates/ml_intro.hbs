<h2>What is learning machines?</h2>

<p>
    Learning machines is a resource for learning about and interacting
    with machine learning. Learning machines also happens to be developed using

</p>

<h2>What is machine learning?</h2>

<p>
    There are many different sub fields of machine learning but they
    all boil down to roughly the following: machine learning is about
    solving a problem without explicitly programming that solution.
</p>

<p>
    Another way to think of this is that with machine learning we hope
    that by providing more experience to the computer program it will
    perform better at it's defined task. In contrast to more standard
    techniques, where we as programmers must consider all possible inputs,
    machine learning is great for helping us solve problems where we couldn't
    possibly descrube all possible solutions.

<h3>How do machines learn?</h3>

<p>
    Hopefully machine learning sounds pretty exciting to you! However,
    we haven't really address how machine learn. Can we really trust
    our computer program to self-improve just by feeding it information?
</p>

<p>
    There is a wealth of theory behind machine learning that says: "Yes, well... Kind of."
    We're not going to spend too much time discussing this theory but if you're interested
    there are some great resources online (<i>Which we should include references too.</i>).
</p>

<p>
    With regards to our initial question - machine learn in a variety of ways. But all
    of them come back to once core thing - <b>data</b>. In order for our machines to learn
    from experience we must have a bank of experiences for them to access. This might be
    data retrieved by the program interacting with the real world or historic data gathered
    over the span of years and fed to the machine all at once.
</p>

<p>
    With this website we'll explore what's going on under the hood in some
    common machine learning techniques. There will also be the opportunity to
    interact with some of these models to get a feel for how they behave in the real world.
